# Vue.js State Management Standards

This document outlines conventions for state management within the Vue.js frontend (`FinanceTracker.Web`) of the FinanceTracker project.

**(User: Please specify the state management library you intend to use, e.g., Pinia, Vuex, or if you plan to use simple Vue 3 Composables for state management. The content below is a general placeholder.)**

## General Principles

- **Single Source of Truth:** State should have a single source of truth.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Follow a unidirectional data flow pattern.
- **Modularity:** Organize state into logical modules or stores.
- **Immutability:** (Specify if state mutations should be handled immutably, if applicable to the chosen library/pattern).

## [Chosen Library/Pattern, e.g., Pinia]

### Store Definition

- **Naming:**
  - Store files: `use[StoreName]Store.ts` (e.g., `useAuthStore.ts`, `useTransactionStore.ts`).
  - Store ID: `camelCase` (e.g., `auth`, `transactions`).
- **Structure:**
  - Define state, getters, and actions clearly within the store.
  - **State:** Define the shape of the state using TypeScript interfaces.
  - **Getters:** Use getters for derived state.
  - **Actions:** Use actions for asynchronous operations or complex synchronous mutations.
- **Modularity:** Break down large stores into smaller, more manageable modules if necessary.

### Usage in Components

- **Accessing State/Getters:** (How to access state and getters in components).
- **Calling Actions:** (How to dispatch actions from components).
- **Type Safety:** Ensure type safety when interacting with the store.

## [Alternative: Vue 3 Composables for State]

- **Composable Naming:** `use[FeatureName]State.ts` (e.g., `useUserState.ts`).
- **Structure:**
  - Use `ref`, `reactive`, `computed` for state and derived state.
  - Export functions to modify state.
- **Sharing State:** (How composables are shared across components, e.g., provide/inject or simple imports).

## API Interaction within State Management

- **Location of API Calls:** API calls that affect global state should typically reside within store actions or equivalent logic in composables.
- **Loading/Error States:** Manage loading and error states related to API calls within the store.
- **Caching:** (Define caching strategies if applicable).
