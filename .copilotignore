# GitHub Copilot Ignore File
# This file tells Copilot which files and directories to ignore.
# It helps improve suggestions by focusing on relevant source code.

# Local development settings that should not influence Copilot suggestions
# These often contain machine-specific or sensitive information.
appsettings.Development.json
**/Properties/launchSettings.json # Can contain user-specific launch profiles, often better for Copilot to ignore.

# Frontend specific (Vue, Vite, Node.js)
# Build output directories
dist/ # Standard for Vite/Vue and other frontend builds
.output/ # Common for some frameworks
.vitepress/dist # If using VitePress
.nuxt/ # If using Nuxt.js

# Project-specific ignores from your workspace structure
# Sensitive data in the AppHost project
FinanceTracker.AppHost/SqlData/secrets/

# IDE-specific folders
# These often contain user-specific settings.
# If your .vscode/ contains shared configurations like tasks.json or launch.json
# that are important for Copilot to understand your project, consider commenting this out
# or using more specific patterns (e.g., .vscode/*.db, .vscode/settings.json).
# Copilot is already aware of your tasks via other means.
# .vscode/
# .idea/ # For JetBrains IDEs

# Azure specific (if generated locally and not meant for Copilot's context)
# .azure/ # Contains local Azure Developer CLI (AZD) environment settings.
          # These are usually gitignored and might not be relevant for general code suggestions
          # unless you are specifically working on AZD configurations.
