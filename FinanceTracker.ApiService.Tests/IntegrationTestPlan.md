# FinanceTracker API Integration Test Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive integration testing strategy for all API endpoints in the FinanceTracker.ApiService project. Each test will use .NET Aspire testing infrastructure to ensure proper integration between services.

## Testing Strategy

All integration tests will:
- Use the existing `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder` with the AppHost
- Target the `apiservice` resource (not the `web` resource)
- Wait for the service to be in `Running` state before testing
- Use realistic test data following domain constraints
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Validate response status codes, headers, and content

## Test Structure

Tests will be organized into separate test classes by endpoint group:
- `AccountEndpointsIntegrationTests.cs`
- `TransactionEndpointsIntegrationTests.cs`
- `TransactionSplitEndpointsIntegrationTests.cs`
- `TransactionCategoryEndpointsIntegrationTests.cs`
- `TransactionTypeEndpointsIntegrationTests.cs`
- `AccountTypeEndpointsIntegrationTests.cs`
- `RecurringTransactionEndpointsIntegrationTests.cs`

## Next Steps

1. **Create Test Infrastructure**
   - Create base test classes with common setup
   - Implement test data seeding utilities
   - Create helper methods for HTTP operations

2. **Start with Core Endpoints**
   - Begin with Account endpoints (most fundamental)
   - Progress to Transaction endpoints
   - Add supporting endpoint tests

3. **Add Advanced Testing**
   - Implement error scenario testing
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Create data consistency validation

4. **Continuous Integration**
   - Ensure tests run in CI/CD pipeline
   - Add test coverage reporting
   - Implement test result tracking
